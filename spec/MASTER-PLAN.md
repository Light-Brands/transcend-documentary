# Bringing the Lost Traveler Back Home

**A Documentary Series presented by Transcend Clinic**

---

## Logline

A man rescued from the brink of suicide receives a mandate to "bring the lost travelers home." In obeying it, he walks alongside others as they confront what they've been running from — revealing how healing happens when people are held in the right place, at the right time, with the right care.

---

## What This Is

**Bringing the Lost Traveler Back Home** is a cinematic, multi-episode documentary series.

Each episode follows one individual at a moment of inner reckoning — while contributing to a larger journey of return.

**This is not a story about substances.**

It is a story about people, and the places that help them come home to themselves.

---

## The Through-Line of the Series

The unifying thread of the entire series is **Nicholas**.

Nicholas spent most of his life imprisoned by addiction, mental illness, and despair — until a chance encounter and a profound plant-medicine experience altered the trajectory of his life, marriage, and purpose.

Six months later, he begins walking with others.

Not as a healer.
Not as an expert.
But as someone obedient to a calling:

**To bring lost travelers home — by walking with them into places where truth, safety, and integration are possible.**

---

## The Place That Holds the Journey

Every journey in this series passes through a place.

A place where people are received with seriousness.
Where ancient intelligence is approached with modern care.
Where healing is not rushed, promised, or commodified.

**That place is Transcend Clinic.**

Transcend is not positioned as a solution —
but as a container.

A place where individuals are prepared, supported, and integrated —
so that confrontation leads to return, not fragmentation.

**The series reveals Transcend's work through how people are held, not through explanation.**

---

## How the Series Is Structured

- Each episode centers on **one individual**
- Each story stands alone as a **complete film**
- All episodes are woven together through **Nicholas's relationships and presence**
- The medicine is **contextual — never central**
- Integration, responsibility, and care guide every narrative choice

This allows the series to exist as:

1. A cohesive cinematic body of work
2. And a set of deeply human, standalone stories

---

## Where the Journey Begins — and Where It Leads

The series begins in the chaos of modern Western life —
overdose, anxiety, burnout, isolation, quiet despair.

It moves through moments of decision, courage, and confrontation —
inside a place built to hold that weight.

And it ultimately points toward a deeper remembering:

**That healing is not an intervention, but a return —
to self, to truth, to relationship.**

---

## Episode One — The Beginning

The first episode filmed follows an **MMA fighter**.

This story is chosen intentionally to set the tone.

It explores:

- High performance
- Neurological risk
- Identity and fatherhood
- The courage to face what strength has required

This episode establishes the emotional, ethical, and narrative standard for the entire series.

**It is the first chapter — not the definition of the story.**

---

## The Stories We Will Follow

Across the series, we walk with:

### The Catalyst — Nicholas
A life resurrected, now walking with others

### The Pastor
Wrestling with God, trauma, and fear

### The MMA Fighter
Navigating performance, brain health, and identity

### The Businessman
Silencing decades of mental noise and armor

### The Wife
Refusing to abandon her soul to survive

### The Carrier
A man fighting to keep the integrity of the medicine

---

**Different lives.**
**Same human reckoning.**

---

## The World This Series Responds To

We are living in the most medicated, addicted, depressed, and disconnected society in history.

These are not personal failures.
They are cultural symptoms.

This series asks a dangerous and necessary question:

**What if the thing we are most afraid to face
is the very thing that can heal us?**

---

## Ibogaine in the Story

Across the series, Ibogaine is never framed as a cure.

It appears as:

- Ancient intelligence
- Approached with modern medical responsibility
- A catalyst that demands preparation, safety, and integration

The medicine is not extracted from culture —
it is returned to relationship.

**And Transcend is shown as a place willing to carry that responsibility.**

---

## A Dual-Purpose Series

Each episode is designed to serve two purposes:

1. **A chapter in the documentary series**
2. **A legacy story for the individual** — usable for education, speaking, and future platforms

This ensures the series grows as a unified body of work
while honoring each person's story as their own.

---

## Why This Matters

The darkest parts of us — addiction, fear, shame, trauma — are not defects.

**They are maps.**

When we stop running from them, we don't just heal.

**We remember who we are.**

This series offers a new story of recovery — rooted in:

- Self-acceptance
- Spiritual reconnection
- Neurological and emotional integration

---

## The Vision

This is not just a documentary.

It is a living record of how healing happens when people are met with care, courage, and the right container.

**One person.**
**One family.**
**One nervous system at a time.**

From shame to belonging.
From fragmentation to wholeness.
From lost to found.

**The lost traveler is coming home.**

---

## The Ask

This page is not asking for approval.

**It is asking for partnership.**

If this vision resonates —
if this feels like work worth stewarding —
the next step is a conversation.

This is not about visibility.

**It is about legacy.**
